            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              This project is about the design and development process where I created a 
              restaurant webpage using React. The design for this webpage is a result of 
              doing competitive analysis on three distinct websites being McDonald’s, 
              Chili’s, and In-N-Out. Through this analysis, I have developed a webpage 
              that uses the strengths and addresses the weaknesses of each restaurant, 
              thereby incorporating sorting, filtering, and data aggregation to create an 
              intuitive user experience.

              <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
              <p> 
                Below is the competitive analysis that was done for each of the following
                resteraunts. To guide my analysis, I observed how each sorted and filtered their 
                information, displayed their items, and guided their users to see how their decisions 
                would impact the user experience. Below is the resulting table of the analysis as well as a 
                short description for each resteraunt describing what was and was not succesful about 
                their design decisions. <b>Click on a resteraunt's corresponding image to be taken to 
                their webpage. </b>

        <h2>McDonald's</h2>
        <div class="content-container">
          <div class="text-content">
            <p>
              
              The most successful aspect of the McDonald's menu webpage is its convenience for obtaining
              information. This is because everything a user needs regarding an item's information,
              such as allergens or nutrition, can be found on a single page through dropdown items.
              The least successful design choice of the McDonald's webpage is the presence of an 
              "Order Now" button that requires the user to download the McDonald's app or be redirected 
              to another company's webpage. This is a weakpoint as it adds a substaional amount
              of clicks to someone ordering food which can potentially lose customers
              as it substantially decreases the efficiency of the page which is a design
              principle learned in class.

        <h2>Chili's</h2>
        <div class="content-container">
          <div class="text-content">
            <p>
              The biggest strength of the Chili's webpage is that it provides the
              essentials for each item on a card, including the item's picture, 
              ingredients, caloric value, price, and an 'add to cart' button. 
              This is beneficial because it allows users to quickly assess whether
              they want the item which results in faster ordering. However, the main 
              weakness of this webpage is that nutritional facts and allergen 
              information are not only located on a different page but also in a separate 
              file that needs to be opened. This is problematic because, firstly, users have
              to locate the small link to the information at the bottom of the item page
              which contradicts the design principle in class where text shouldn't be tool
              small. Secondly, the PDF contains a crowded chart with information for the entire 
              menu, which can lead to mistakes when users try to find specific details.

        <h2>In-N-Out</h2>
        <div class="content-container">
          <div class="text-content">
            <p>
              The strength of In-N-Out's webpage lies in its straightforward design, 
              which makes it easy for users to navigate the menu. This simplicity is
              a result of its few interactive elements being a list of menu items, a 
              large image of each item, and a button that shows a popup of the ingredients
              for the item. However, the main drawback of this webpage is the lack of detailed
              information as it primarily relies on images to convey details which 
              goes against design principles discussed in class. This is a significant 
              disadvantage because it forces users to spend more time searching for what 
              they are looking for. Furthermore since the webpage relies on images, it presents
              a challenge for users with low vision making it difficult for them to process the page.

            Below is the deployed page! <b>Click the image below to be taken to the webpage.</b> 
            The webpage I created is a menu for a resteraunt that aims to merge aspects from each website I've observed. To 
            incorporate filtering, I implemented buttons on the toolbar. Clicking these buttons 
            will filter items based on allergen factors and their vegan status. Clicking the 
            buttons again will revert the view to its original state. For sorting, I included 
            two dropdown menu items: the first orders items by alphabetical order, price, or 
            rating, while the second determines whether the order is ascending or descending. 
            There is also a 'Reset All' button that when clicked, will revert the page to the 
            original state. Finally, as it's an online menu for a resteraunt, there is an 'Add to Cart'
            button that when clicked will add the desired item to an easily accessible and modifiable cart.
            When viewing the cart, it will allow a user to add or subtract current items, proceed with their purchase,
            or restart the process.

        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>User experience is vital:</b> Throughout the project, I learned how important
            the user experience in web design is by analyzing restaurant websites to learn what 
            works well and what doesn't in terms of organizing information, providing essential 
            details, and allowing smooth user interactions. By focusing on the user experience,
            I aimed to create a ordering process that gave every type of user a seamless process.
          </li>

          <li><b>The importance of learning new libraries:</b>  For this project, I had to 
                 quickly learn and adapt to React and one of its open-source libraries, Material UI.
                 While learning react and its libraries were challenging to me, it not only expanded
                 my skill set but also allowed me to use the pre-built components
                 and design systems effectively to streamline the development processes.
